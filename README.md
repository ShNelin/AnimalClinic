Animal Clinic Management System

IN PROGRES 

This is a Windows Forms application built in C# with an Oracle database backend. The project allows managing animal species and breeds, tracking veterinarians, and handling visits. Users can add, edit, and view species and breeds, with automatic ID generation and data validation to prevent duplicates. The application uses DataGridView controls for easy data display and supports combo boxes for selecting species when adding breeds.
